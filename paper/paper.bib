	abstract = {Dynamical dependence between key observables and the surface mass balance (SMB) over Antarctica is analyzed in two historical runs performed with the MPI-ESM-P and the CESM1-CAM5 climate models. The approach used is a novel method allowing for evaluating the rate of information transfer between observables that goes beyond the classical correlation analysis and allows for directional characterization of dependence. It reveals that a large proportion of significant correlations do not lead to dependence. In addition, three coherent results concerning the dependence of SMB emerge from the analysis of both models: (i) The SMB over the Antarctic Plateau is mostly influenced by the surface temperature and sea ice concentration and not by large-scale circulation changes; (ii) the SMB of the Weddell Sea and the Dronning Maud Land coasts are not influenced significantly by the surface temperature; and (iii) the Weddell Sea coast is not significantly influenced by the sea ice concentration.},

In our study, we make use of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute Large Ensemble. This ensemble consists of 50 members realized with the EC-Earth3 global climate model and covers the period 1970-2100. We apply for the first time the Liang-Kleeman information flow method to analyze the cause-effect relationships between Arctic sea ice and its potential drivers. We show that recent and future changes in Arctic sea ice are mainly driven by air and sea-surface temperatures and ocean heat transport. Conversely, changes in Arctic sea ice also considerably impact temperature and ocean heat transport. Finally, we find a progressive decrease in the influence of sea-ice area and volume on air temperature and ocean heat transport through the twenty-first century.},

	abstract = {Given two time series, can one faithfully tell, in a rigorous and quantitative way, the cause and effect between them? Based on a recently rigorized physical notion, namely, information flow, we solve an inverse problem and give this important and challenging question, which is of interest in a wide variety of disciplines, a positive answer. Here causality is measured by the time rate of information flowing from one series to the other. The resulting formula is tight in form, involving only commonly used statistics, namely, sample covariances; an immediate corollary is that causation implies correlation, but correlation does not imply causation. It has been validated with touchstone linear and nonlinear series, purportedly generated with one-way causality that evades the traditional approaches. It has also been applied successfully to the investigation of real-world problems; an example presented here is the cause-and-effect relation between the two climate modes, El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which have been linked to hazards in far-flung regions of the globe. In general, the two modes are mutually causal, but the causality is asymmetric: El Niño tends to stabilize IOD, while IOD functions to make El Niño more uncertain. To El Niño, the information flowing from IOD manifests itself as a propagation of uncertainty from the Indian Ocean.},

It is verified with autoregressive models and applied to a real financial analysis problem.

	abstract = {Information flow or information transfer the widely applicable general physics notion can be rigorously derived from first principles, rather than axiomatically proposed as an ansatz. Its logical association with causality is firmly rooted in the dynamical system that lies beneath. The principle of nil causality that reads, an event is not causal to another if the evolution of the latter is independent of the former, which transfer entropy analysis and Granger causality test fail to verify in many situations, turns out to be a proven theorem here. Established in this study are the information flows among the components of time-discrete mappings and time-continuous dynamical systems, both deterministic and stochastic. They have been obtained explicitly in closed form, and put to applications with the benchmark systems such as the Kaplan-Yorke map, Rössler system, baker transformation, Hénon map, and stochastic potential flow. Besides unraveling the causal relations as expected from the respective systems, some of the applications show that the information flow structure underlying a complex trajectory pattern could be tractable. For linear systems, the resulting remarkably concise formula asserts analytically that causation implies correlation, while correlation does not imply causation, providing a mathematical basis for the long-standing philosophical debate over causation versus correlation.},

	abstract = {The relative contributions of ocean modes to the JJA and DJF land precipitation variabilities during 1934–2015 are investigated using a variety of statistical and dynamical system methods, i.e., singular value decomposition (SVD), multivariate linear regression, and information flow analysis. Through SVD analysis for the tropical land precipitation and sea surface temperature (SST), three ocean modes are found to most affect the trend and interdecadal variation of the land precipitation. They are the global warming (GW) mode, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). GW contributes dominantly to the tropical land rainfall variability in both the JJA and DJF seasons. In JJA (DJF), AMO (IPO) plays a role only secondary to GW. Locally, within the thin latitude bands 10° S–10° N, 50° N–60° N and 40° S–50° S, GW, AMO and IPO are of equal importance in JJA; outside these bands, in the same season the first two dominate. In the band 10° N–40° N, IPO is the primary contributor in DJF, but outside it, GW dominates. Also, these contributions differ geographically from continent to continent. These results have been substantiated in the application of information flow analysis, a recently developed method in physics for the inference of causality between dynamical events. In terms of information flow, we have presented the regions of sensitivity to the three modes. Also presented are a number of ECHAM model experiments, which, besides verifying the above results, show for the first time that the Indian Ocean is pivotal in having AMO and IPO in effect in causing the precipitation variabilities.},

	abstract = {Children and youth are at a greater risk of concussions than adults, and once injured, take longer to recover. A key feature of concussion is an increase in functional connectivity; yet it remains unclear how changes in functional connectivity relate to the patterns of information flow within resting state networks and how these relate to brain function. We applied a data-driven measure of directed effective brain connectivity to compare the patterns of information flow in healthy adolescents and adolescents with subacute concussion during the resting state condition. Data from 32 healthy adolescents and 21 concussed adolescents within 1 week of injury were included in the study. Five minutes of resting state data EEG were collected.. We applied the information flow rate to measure the transfer of information between the EEG time series of each individual at different source locations, and therefore between different brain regions. Based on the ensemble means of the magnitude of normalized information flow rate, our analysis shows that the dominant nexus of information flow in healthy adolescents is primarily left lateralized and anterior-centric, characterized by strong bidirectional information exchange between the frontal regions, and between the frontal and the central/temporal regions.In contrast, adolescents with concussion show distinct differences in information flow marked by a more left-right symmetrical, albeit still primarily anterior-centric, pattern of connections, diminished activity along the central-parietal midline axis, and the emergence of inter-hemispheric connections between the left and right frontal and the left and right temporal regions of the brain. We also find that the statistical distribution of the normalized information flow rates in each group (control and concussed) is significantly different. This paper is the first to describe the characteristics of the source space information flow and the effective connectivity patterns between brain regions in healthy adolescents in juxtaposition with the altered spatial pattern of information flow in adolescents with concussion, and quantify statistically the differences in the distribution of the information flow rate between the two populations. We hypothesize that the observed changes in information flow in the concussed group indicate functional reorganizationof resting state networks in response to brain injury.},

The formalism has been validated and put to application with a variety of benchmark systems, such as the baker transformation, Hénon map, truncated Burgers-Hopf system, Langevin equation, etc. In the chaotic Burgers-Hopf system, all the transfers, save for one, are essentially zero, indicating that the processes underlying a dynamical phenomenon, albeit complex, could be simple. (Truth is simple.) In the Langevin equation case, it is found that there could be no information flowing from one certain time series to another series, though the two are highly correlated.

	doi = {10.3390/e23060679},
	abstract = {Causality analysis is an important problem lying at the heart of science, and is of particular importance in data science and machine learning. An endeavor during the past 16 years viewing causality as a real physical notion so as to formulate it from first principles, however, seems to have gone unnoticed. This study introduces to the community this line of work, with a long-due generalization of the information flow-based bivariate time series causal inference to multivariate series, based on the recent advance in theoretical development. The resulting formula is transparent, and can be implemented as a computationally very efficient algorithm for application. It can be normalized and tested for statistical significance. Different from the previous work along this line where only information flows are estimated, here an algorithm is also implemented to quantify the influence of a unit to itself. While this forms a challenge in some causal inferences, here it comes naturally, and hence the identification of self-loops in a causal graph is fulfilled automatically as the causalities along edges are inferred. To demonstrate the power of the approach, presented here are two applications in extreme situations. The first is a network of multivariate processes buried in heavy noises (with the noise-to-signal ratio exceeding 100), and the second a network with nearly synchronized chaotic oscillators. In both graphs, confounding processes exist. While it seems to be a challenge to reconstruct from given series these causal graphs, an easy application of the algorithm immediately reveals the desideratum. Particularly, the confounding processes have been accurately differentiated. Considering the surge of interest in the community, this study is very timely.},

For a region in the South China Sea where eddies frequently appear but unobserved, it is shown that the algorithm can reconstruct the desired mesoscale eddies in a remarkably successful way in geometry, orientation, strength, etc., while with the objective analysis interpolation or the traditional neural network technique, the results are not satisfactory.

The resulting formula bears the same form as that for the former, though the meanings of the symbols differ. An algorithm is then proposed for panel data causality analysis, which has been validated with both linear and nonlinear problems. It has also been put to application to examine the causal relations among economic growth, energy consumption, trade openness, and energy price based on 15 Asian countries. Clearly identified are a strong bidirectional causality between economic growth and energy consumption, and a strong causality from import and export trade to economic growth. Energy price has no direct impact on energy consumption; it, instead, exerts a weak effect on the latter through influencing economic growth.},

	abstract = {We propose to meta-learn causal structures based on how fast a learner adapts to new distributions arising from sparse distributional changes, e.g. due to interventions, actions of agents and other sources of non-stationarities. We show that under this assumption, the correct causal structural choices lead to faster adaptation to modified distributions because the changes are concentrated in one or just a few mechanisms when the learned knowledge is modularized appropriately. This leads to sparse expected gradients and a lower effective number of degrees of freedom needing to be relearned while adapting to the change. It motivates using the speed of adaptation to a modified distribution as a meta-learning objective. We demonstrate how this can be used to determine the cause-effect relationship between two observed variables. The distributional changes do not need to correspond to standard interventions (clamping a variable), and the learner has no direct knowledge of these interventions. We show that causal structures can be parameterized via continuous variables and learned end-to-end. We then explore how these ideas could be used to also learn an encoder that would map low-level observed variables to unobserved causal variables leading to faster adaptation out-of-distribution, learning a representation space where one can satisfy the assumptions of independent mechanisms and of small and sparse changes in these mechanisms due to actions and non-stationarities.},

	abstract = {Liang information flow is widely used in classical systems and network theory for causality quantification and has been applied widely, for example, to finance, neuroscience, and climate studies. The key part of the theory is to freeze a node of a network to ascertain its causal influence on other nodes. Such a theory is yet to be applied to quantum network dynamics. Here, we generalize the Liang information flow to the quantum domain with respect to von Neumann entropy and exemplify its usage by applying it to a variety of small quantum networks.},

	abstract = {Causal inference seeks to identify cause-and-effect interactions in coupled systems. A recently proposed method by Liang detects causal relations by quantifying the direction and magnitude of information flow between time series. The theoretical formulation of information flow for stochastic dynamical systems provides a general expression and a data-driven statistic for the rate of entropy transfer between different system units. To advance understanding of information flow rate in terms of intuitive concepts and physically meaningful parameters, we investigate statistical properties of the data-driven information flow rate between coupled stochastic processes. We derive relations between the expectation of the information flow rate statistic and properties of the auto- and cross-correlation functions. Thus, we elucidate the dependence of the information flow rate on the analytical properties and characteristic times of the correlation functions. Our analysis provides insight into the influence of the sampling step, the strength of cross-correlations, and the temporal delay of correlations on information flow rate. We support the theoretical results with numerical simulations of correlated Gaussian processes.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are a graph-based methodology successfully applied for knowledge representation of complex systems modelled through an interactive structure of nodes connected with causal relationships. Due to their flexibility and inherent interpretability, FCMs have been used in various modelling and prediction tasks to support human decisions. However, a notable limitation of FCMs is their susceptibility to inadvertently capturing spurious correlations from data, undermining their prediction accuracy and interpretability. In addressing this challenge, our primary contribution is the introduction of a novel framework for constructing FCMs using the Liang-Kleeman Information Flow (L-K IF) analysis, a quantitative causality analysis rigorously derived from first principles. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the identification of actual causal relationships from the data using an automatic causal search algorithm. These relationships are subsequently imposed as constraints in the FCM learning procedure to rule out spurious correlations and improve the aggregate predictive and explanatory power of the model. Numerical simulations validate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art FCM-based models, thereby bolstering the reliability, accuracy, and interpretability of FCMs.},

	abstract = {It has been said, arguably, that causality analysis should pave a promising way to interpretable deep learning and generalization. Incorporation of causality into artificial intelligence algorithms, however, is challenged with its vagueness, nonquantitativeness, computational inefficiency, etc. During the past 18 years, these challenges have been essentially resolved, with the establishment of a rigorous formalism of causality analysis initially motivated from atmospheric predictability. This not only opens a new field in the atmosphere-ocean science, namely, information flow, but also has led to scientific discoveries in other disciplines, such as quantum mechanics, neuroscience, financial economics, etc., through various applications. This note provides a brief review of the decade-long effort, including a list of major theoretical results, a sketch of the causal deep learning framework, and some representative real-world applications pertaining to this journal, such as those on the anthropogenic cause of global warming, the decadal prediction of El Niño Modoki, the forecasting of an extreme drought in China, among others.},

Analytical formulas have been obtained in a closed form. Under a Gaussian assumption, their maximum likelihood estimators have also been obtained. These formulas have been validated using different subsystems with preset relations, and they yield causalities just as expected. On the contrary, the commonly used proxies for the characterization of subsystems, such as averages and principal components, generally do not work correctly. This study can help diagnose the emergence of patterns in complex systems and is expected to have applications in many real world problems in different disciplines such as climate science, ﬂuid dynamics, neuroscience, ﬁnancial economics, etc.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder with severe cognitive impairment in social communication and interaction. Previous studies have reported that abnormal functional connectivity patterns within the default mode network (DMN) were associated with social dysfunction in ASD. However, how the altered causal connectivity pattern within the DMN affects the social functioning in ASD remains largely unclear. Here, we introduced the Liang information flow method, widely applied to climate science and quantum mechanics, to uncover the brain causal network patterns in ASD. Compared with the healthy controls (HC), we observed that the interactions among the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC), ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), hippocampal formation, and temporo-parietal junction showed more inter-regional causal connectivity differences in ASD. For the topological property analysis, we also found the clustering coefficient of DMN and the In-Out degree of anterior medial prefrontal cortex were significantly decreased in ASD. Furthermore, we found that the causal connectivity from dMPFC to vMPFC was correlated with the clinical symptoms of ASD. These altered causal connectivity patterns indicated that the DMN inter-regions information processing was perturbed in ASD. In particular, we found that the dMPFC acts as a causal source in the DMN in HC, whereas it plays a causal target in ASD. Overall, our findings indicated that the Liang information flow method could serve as an important way to explore the DMN causal connectivity patterns, and it also can provide novel insights into the nueromechanisms underlying DMN dysfunction in ASD.},
