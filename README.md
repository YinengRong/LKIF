## About the module
Causal analysis, a fundamental aspect in various disciplines, has consistently garnered significant attention from the scientific community. In recent years, it has been recognized as a promising approach to explaining and generalizing deep learning. However, the incorporation of causality into the artificial intelligence algorithms poses challenges such as ambiguity, non-quantifiability, and computational inefficiency. Over the past two decades (Liang and Kleeman, 2005), substantial progress has been made in addressing these challenges through the development of a **quantitative causal theory â€” the Liang information flow theory**. This rigorous theory, derived from first principles, has resulted in notable scientific discoveries in fields ranging from finance, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence to climate science and oceanography. This module provides a practical implementation of the theory, complete with core code and selected examples.

# Requirements
* numpy
* scipy

# Installation
To install **LK_Info_flow** package, use `pip` as follows:
```sh
  pip install LK_Info_flow
```
or
```sh
pip install .\dist\LK_Info_flow-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Standard Call for time series or panel data
```sh
from LK_Info_Flow import causal
IF_result=causal.multi_causality_est_OLS(X, max_lag=1, np=1, dt=1, series_temporal_order=None, significance_test=1):
IF_result['IF']
```

**Inputs**:
   X: matrix storing the M time series (each as Nx1 column vectors)
   
   max_lag: time order of lags (default 1)
   
     >=1 lag time step
   
     -1 Determine the lag order of the data based on the AIC criterion.
   
     -2 Determine the lag order of the data based on the BIC criterion.
     
   np: integer >=1, time advance in performing Euler forward differencing, e.g., 1, 2. Unless the series are generated with a highly chaotic deterministic system, np=1 should be used. 
   
   (default 1)
   
   dt: frequency of sampling 
   
   (default 1)
   
   series_teporal_order: Nx1 column vector that records the timestamps of each sample, with a minimum sampling interval of dt. This option is used for panel data or datasets with missing measurements.
   
   (default [])
   
   significance_test:  1  do the significance test (default)
   
                       0  not (to save the computation time)

**outputs**:
   IF:               information flow
   
   nIF:              normalized information flow
   
   max_lag:          time order of lags (in IF)
   
   SEIF:             standard error of information flow
   
   err_e90/e95/e99: standard error at 90/95/99# significance level
   
   p:                p-value of information flow


### Standard Call for subsystems
```sh
from LK_Info_Flow import causal
IF_result=causal.group_est(X, ind, np=1, dt=1):
IF_result['TAB']
```

**Inputs**:
   X: matrix storing the M time series (each as Nx1 column vectors)

   ind: 2X1 vector (0<=ind[0]<ind[1]<=M); The series of the components of subsystem A are stored in column [0:ind[0]], and the components of subsystem B are in column [ind[0]:ind[1]]

   np(default 1): integer >=1, time advance in performing Euler forward differencing, e.g., 1, 2. Unless the series are generated with a highly chaotic deterministic system, np=1 should be used. 
   
   dt(default 1): frequency of sampling 
     
   
**outputs**:
    TAB: info flow from subspace A to subspace B
    TBA: info flow from subspace B to subspace A


**More details are in the example file(**More details are in the example file(https://github.com/YinengRong/LKIF/blob/main/IF_3.0/LK_Info_Flow/examples/example.ipynb)**

There are 8 cases in the file:

1 bivariate causality

2 multivariable causality

3 causality on panel data, discontinuous time series or ensemble data

4 subsystems causality

5 time delay, latent confunders, cyclic causality

6 Large scale computing cost on Liang information flow

7 causality on the data with cross-correlated noise

8 temperal varying causality
